### name: uday kalyan S
### roll no: 24AI10014

### tasks: 
- B01-RAC(complete in backend, frontend incomplete)
- B03-RAC(slightly complete in backend, left to implement server side validation, slight frontend work complete)

basic express app is in app.js
routes are in a seperate file along with the (passwordless)db schemas/models
i use pnpm instead of npm(used to run my life on mobile data) but i think npm should work the same too

#### hello yall!
im uday. ive started out with gamedev initially but ive done a fair bit of web dev back during the pandemic era. ive lost a little(lot) of touch but so far ive worked with
- express
- svelte
- (we all make bad choices) some angular
---------------------------------------------

as of non web dev stuff, ive found rust cool and tried building some stuff in it. i also tried a bit of interpreter design from crafting interpreters but havent finished it yet

anyways id love to get back to web dev. and i do love watching anime too

as of projs, i dont have too much to show, there is a chip 8 interpreter, a very basic chat app and a whole lot of Advent of code solutions in my github. i used to love doing AOC during the winter. got a bit competetive with a friend of mine
